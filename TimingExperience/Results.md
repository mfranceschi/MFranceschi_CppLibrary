# Introduction
During the creation process of this library, I wanted to ensure that my code ran as fast as possible.

For instance, there are several ways of getting a file size in Windows:
* You can get the position of a stream (FILE* or fstream) after positioning it at the end of the file.
* You can use system calls to retrieve the file attribute: the portable `fstat`, the Windows-only brother `GetFileInformationEx`.
* You can use a system call to retrieve the file size directly: the Windows-only `GetFileSizeEx`.
* Probably other functions that I don't know the existence yet.

Four different ways for getting a file size, all of them take from one to four lines, and take no longer than a few microseconds to run. But **which one is the fastest**? This simple question was my goal. I also wanted to ensure that my observations were great enough to be considered acceptable.

In this document, I will present the results I obtained. Please note that all timing results are taken from the same run of the script. Of course, please feel free to run it by yourself. Normally CMake should have generated an executable with the "*Shlwapi.dll*" dependency.

# Results
Result of the timing function, without anything to run (empty lambda function): `3.3187e-07` seconds. It can be considered as a default offset.

## Check if, given a filepath, the file exists
I have two constants that hold the same file path as C-strings, one of them being a `const char*` and the other a `const wchar_t*`. All the functions called have to write into a shared integer variable the boolean return.

1. [Windows-only] `PathFileExists`: 2.06946e-05 seconds.
2. `stat`: 3.40244e-05 seconds.
3. [Windows-only]: `GetFileAttributes`: 1.72648e-05 seconds.

For a request as simple as checking a file existence, where no other information should be gathered, seeing that (3) is faster that (1) is quite surprising.
